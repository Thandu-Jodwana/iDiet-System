# Kanban Board Explanation

## Definition of a Kanban Board:

I would describe Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that helps in tracking tasks through different stages of completion.
 It consists of columns representing different progress stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and cards representing individual tasks. This system comes with improved transparency, limits work overload, and supports Agile principles for continuous delivery. It is important in software development and project management, as it helps teams visualize work, optimize efficiency, and manage workflows by ensuring a steady pace of task completion. By using Kanban, teams can reduce bottlenecks, minimize idle time, and continuously improve their processes through real-time adjustments and feedback.

## How the iDiet Kanban Board Visualizes Workflow:

### Our Kanban board consists of the following columns:

**-To Do:** These would be tasked that are yet to be started with.

**-In Progress:** These are all the tasks that are actively being worked on/ongoing.

**-Testing:** Tasks undergoing quality assurance checks.

**-Blocked:** Tasks that are halted due to dependencies or issues.

**-Done:** This consists of all completed tasks ready for deployment.


Each user story is assigned to a column based on its status. This structure provides clear visualization of project progress and allows team members to see where tasks stand at a glance.

## How the iDiet Kanban Board Limits Work-In-Progress (WIP):

### To prevent bottlenecks and maintain a steady workflow, we have set WIP limits:

**-In Progress Limit:** No more than 3 tasks can be worked on simultaneously per developer.

**-Testing Limit:** Only 2 tasks can be tested at a time to ensure proper QA focus.

**-Blocked Column Monitoring:** Tasks in this column are reviewed daily to resolve blockers quickly.

By enforcing these limits, our board prevents overloading and maintains an efficient development pace.


## How the iDiet Kanban Board Supports Agile Principles:

**-Continuous Delivery:** By categorizing tasks and linking them to GitHub Issues, the board enables regular incremental updates.

**-Adaptability:** The board allows re-prioritization of tasks based on user feedback or changing requirements.

**-Transparency & Collaboration:** Team members can view the status of all tasks, ensuring alignment and accountability.

By using this customized Kanban board, the iDiet system development remains organized, agile, and efficient, allowing seamless tracking of progress and ensuring timely delivery of the MVP.
