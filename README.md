# iDiet-System
The iDiet system is a smart nutrition management platform designed to help people/customers maintain a healthy diet based on their individual preferences, health conditions, and dietary goals. Using AI, the system analyzes user data such as age, weight, activity level, allergies, and medical conditions to generate personalized meal plans and nutritional recommendations.
This system provides nutriotional knowledge to users.

### Justification of Customization Choices:
-I Added a "Testing" column to align with QA requirements and ensure system reliability before deployment.

-I Included a "Blocked" column to track dependencies and prevent development bottlenecks.

-I will later introduce a "Review" column to improve code quality and facilitate peer evaluations.

-Mapped user stories to issues for better traceability and project structure.

-Task assignments ensure accountability, allowing efficient progress tracking across the development cycle.

These customizations ensure the iDiet system remains organized, traceable, and aligned with Agile best practices.
