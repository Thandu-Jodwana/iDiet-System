# Reflection

Translating system requirements into use cases and test cases required a deep understanding of user interactions. Identifying main actors and their interactions ensured completeness in modeling system behavior. One challenge was balancing the granularity of each use cases; defining too many would overcomplicate the model, while too few might take away the important functionalites.

Defining test cases involved aligning them with functional requirements to ensure the system meets user expectations. Another challenge was designing non-functional tests, particularly performance and security validations. These require simulations beyond basic test cases and demand tools for load testing and penetration testing.

Despite these challenges, breaking down system functionality into structured diagrams and test cases provides a clear framework for development and validation, ensuring a robust, user-friendly, and efficient intelligent dietary system.
