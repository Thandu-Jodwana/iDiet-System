## Documentation/Reflection

This document compiles all Agile planning components for the iDiet system, ensuring that all artifactsâ€”user stories, backlog prioritization, and sprint planning are well documented and connected. The user stories are in line with functional requirements and use cases that I've stated before to ensure that there's consistency and a structured development process.

By aligning the product backlog with MoSCoW prioritization and defining a sprint plan with clear goals and tasks, this document provides a roadmap for Agile development. It ensures that the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) delivers core functionalities while allowing for iterative improvements based on future requirements and feedback.

## Challenges Encountered:

**Prioritization:** Balancing security, usability, and integration with external APIs.

**Effort Estimation:** Assigning accurate story points without historical sprint data.

**Scope Definition:** Ensuring that the MVP delivers real value while keeping features manageable.

## Lessons Learned:

Breaking down features into smaller, testable user stories makes sprint planning smoother.

MoSCoW prioritization helped align development with essential business goals.

Agile encourages adaptability, but structuring sprints around critical functionality improves efficiency.
