# Reflection:

Designing the domain model and class diagram for the iDiet system was insightful and challenging at the same time.
The main challenge was around identifying the correct level of detail to represent each class, attribute and method without messing up the model or losing its usability. In the iDiet system, which deals with users, personalized meal plans, subscriptions, nutrition tracking, and interactions with administrators, the temptation to overcomplicate the model was strong. For example, differentiating between **User**, **Dietitian**, and **Admin** while keeping common functionality in a parent class required careful thought. Balancing these variations with abstraction led to the creation of a superclass **User**, with the specialized roles inheriting and extending the base functionality.

Another noticeable challenge was defining and representing class relationships. For instance, the connection between **MealPlan**, **Recipe**, and **Subscription** included both aggregation and composition. Understanding when to apply inheritance against composition required a deeper appreciation of how tightly the classes were grouped. A **MealPlan** made up of **Recipes** seemed like a natural composition, but representing dietary goals and nutrition metrics required associative relationships with tracking mechanisms that should remain loosely coupled. Determining these relationships took time and multiple iterations of the diagram to ensure clarity and accuracy.

In aligning the class diagram with previous assignments, it became clear how important consistency can be in with these assignments. The class diagram was based directly in the functional requirements from *Assignment 4* and the use cases from *Assignment 5*. For example, the **User** and **MealPlan** classes emerged directly from use cases like "Create Meal Plan" and "Subscribe to Plan." Similarly, state diagrams from *Assignment 8* guided object lifecycle modeling, such as in the **Order** and **Subscription** classes, which each had methods and attributes reflecting transitions like "active," "expired," and "cancelled." This reinforced the importance of building software incrementally, where earlier artifacts act as blueprints for more concrete designs and promoting agile development.


Through these exercises, I have gained valuable lessons in object-oriented design. Firstly, the principle of separation of concerns stood out as essential, each class must have a well-defined responsibility, and logic should not be unnecessarily duplicated across classes. Secondly, I learned that domain modeling is as much about communication as it is about structure. A well-designed class diagram can serve as a shared language between developers, analysts, and stakeholders. Lastly, I discovered that iteration is critical. The first version of the model is rarely perfect; feedback and refinement are what make it effective.
