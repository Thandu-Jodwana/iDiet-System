## 1. Repository Sharing

To participate in peer feedback and open contribution, the GitHub repository for the iDiet system has been shared with classmates through the following platforms:

- Class WhatsApp group: The GitHub repo link was posted with a note encouraging feedback and forks.

- Zoom class session: The link was shared in the meeting chat during the class Q&A.

- GitHub Classroom Discussion (if available): An open message was posted for peers to engage with the repo.

- Teams chat: The GitHub repo link was posted with a note encouraging feedback and forks.

## 2. Peer Voting Criteria

My classmates were encouraged to vote (via stars and forks) based on:

### 1. Documentation

* Clear `README.md` with setup, features, and contribution guidelines.
* Includes `ROADMAP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE`.

### 2. Ease of Contribution

* Issues labeled `good-first-issue` and `feature-request`.
* Simple branching strategy described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 3. Feature Completeness

* Fully working REST API (User, MealPlan, Subscription, Order, Ticket).
* Business logic enforced in service layer.
* Integrated testable endpoints.

## Summary

By sharing the iDiet system repository with peers across multiple class platforms and providing clear contribution materials, we enabled collaborative feedback, real user review, and real-time suggestions. The peer voting encouraged classmates to interact with a live codebase, promoting open-source development habits in an academic environment.

**Call to Action:**
