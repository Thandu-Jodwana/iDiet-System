One of the main challenges was balancing personalization with scalability. End users requires highly customized meal plans, while developers need efficiency. This was resolved through AI-driven adaptive meal plans. 

Ensuring scientific accuracy without limiting AI innovation required validation from nutritionists to maintain health safety standards. Another challenge was data privacy versus system integration, which was addressed by implementing secure API authentication. Finally, keeping the system engaging without complicating the UI required a mix of gamification and progress tracking.
